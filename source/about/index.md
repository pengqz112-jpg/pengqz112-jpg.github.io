## About Me

Hi, I’m Zion Peng. I am a scholar passionate about implementing effective, high-reliability machine learning methods to address real-world problems. 

Welcome to my homepage, where I share my latest projects, academic growth, and key milestones.

## What I Do

- **Machine Learning & Research**: Developing robust, data-driven solutions with a focus on efficient and scalable ML methodologies.
- **Academic Writing & Knowledge Sharing**: Synthesizing complex technical concepts into structured notes and scholarly articles.
- **Minimalist Tooling**: Engineering streamlined Python scripts, automations, and side projects designed for maximum impact with minimal overhead.

## Beyond Code

Outside of tech, I enjoy traveling and exploring new cultures worldwide. I value time spent to 'clear my mind', as it allows me to recalibrate my perspective and refine how I think and work.

This site is a simple place to collect all of that in one home.
